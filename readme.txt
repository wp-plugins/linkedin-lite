Features:

- Choose which parts of your profile to display.
- Show your profile in pages and posts by using a shortcode.
- Show your profile in sidebars using the widget.
- Multisite options - Ability to run on a multisite network with just 1 set of API keys.

The plugin uses the LinkedIn API, to use it you will need a set of API keys. This is easy to set up and all instructions are included in the plugin.


IMPORTANT INFO FOR MULTISITE NETWORK USAGE:

- Put the plugin in the regular 'plugins' folder.
